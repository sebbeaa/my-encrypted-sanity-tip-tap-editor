## Custom GrapesJS and Tiptap Editor for Sanity Studio

In this Sanity Studio project, we've integrated a custom Tiptap editor and GrapesJS to offer a comprehensive, interactive, and user-friendly content editing experience. This setup allows for intuitive drag & drop functionality, extensive customization, and real-time updates.

### Features

- **Drag & Drop:** Seamlessly rearrange your content with drag and drop capabilities, provided by both Tiptap and GrapesJS editors.
- **Customizable:** Fully tailor the editor's appearance and functionality to meet your project's specific needs, leveraging GrapesJS's component builder and Tiptap's flexible schema.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Ensure all users view the most current content with real-time changes.
- **Client/Server-Side Encryption:** Secure your content with encryption, enhancing data privacy.
- **TailwindCSS Integration:** Utilize TailwindCSS for styling, ensuring a consistent and modern design system without side loading any CSS.
- **Dynamic Floating Panels:** Create a robust foundation for a very customizable component builder within the studio itself, leveraging the best of GrapesJS.

### Todo

1. Enhance drag & drop functionality for smoother interactions.
2. Introduce more customization options for both editors.
3. Implement real-time collaboration features for team editing.
4. Improve server-side encryption for enhanced security.
5. Develop comprehensive documentation for easy setup and usage.
6. Write unit tests to ensure reliability and stability.
7. Integrate TailwindCSS and dynamic floating panels for a seamless design experience.

### Installation and Deployment

Follow these steps to install and deploy the app in your local environment (ensure pnpm is set up with this project):

```zsh
pnpm i
pnpm dev

pnpm build
pnpm start

pnpm deploy
```

### Configuration

Define a `.env` or `.env.local` file containing these variables:

```plaintext
